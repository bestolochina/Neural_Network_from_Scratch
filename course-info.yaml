summary: "<p>Let's train a very simple but fully connected neural network! In this\
  \ project, we'll create the necessary metric functions and use custom feedforward\
  \ and backpropagation methods and functions, all done by hand. The dataset for this\
  \ project is Fashion-MNIST â€“ no more boring number recognition.</p>"
